# 🌐 Multi-Tenant Forum Platform  

> **A scalable and customizable forum platform for community-driven discussions.**  
> Built with a microservices architecture using **Flask**, **Vue.js**, and hosted on **AWS**.

---

## 📖 Overview  

This platform is designed for communities to host interactive discussions on any topic. Whether it's **sports**, **gaming**, **technology**, or **local communities**, this multi-tenant forum provides a **neutral and customizable** alternative to traditional platforms.  

Each instance can operate independently, with its own branding, user base, and features, while sharing core functionalities like **authentication**, **real-time discussions**, and **virtual interactions**.

## ⚙️ Architecture  

The platform is built with a **microservices architecture** for scalability and maintainability. Here’s a breakdown of its core services:

- 🛡️ **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication, registration, and token-based authorization (JWT).  
- 🚏 **API Gateway**: Manages communication between services and acts as the single entry point for client requests.  
- 📦 **Common Package**: Shared utilities and logic used by multiple services for consistency and efficiency.  
- 🖥️ **Vue.js Frontend**: Delivers a modern, responsive user interface for a seamless user experience.
